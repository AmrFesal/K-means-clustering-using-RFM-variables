# K-means-clustering-using-RFM-variables
Objective : To perform customer segmentation based on key attributes Recency, Frequency & Monetary (RFM) using K-means.

What is customer segmentation?
Customer segmentation is a method of dividing customers into groups or clusters on the basis of common characteristics.
why do we need customer segmentation?
- It will help in identifying the most potential customers.
- It will help managers to easily communicate with a targetted group of the audience.
- It will help managers to design special offers for targetted customers, to encourage them to buy more products.
- It also helps in identifying new products that customers could be interested in.

Types of segmentation
- Demographic(eg. gender,age,occupation etc.)
- Geographic(eg. location,region,urban/rural etc.)
- Behavioral(eg. spending,consumption habits,previously purchased product etc.)
- psychographic(eg. social status,lifestyle,personality characterstics etc.)

What is RFM Analysis?
RFM analysis is a customer segmentation technique that uses past purchase behavior to divide customers into groups,based on

RECENCY (R): Time since last purchase
FREQUENCY (F): Total number of purchases
MONETARY VALUE (M): Total monetary value

K-means clustering algorithm to segment the customers and used Elbow method to find the optimal number of K clusters.

Main Python Libraries used:
- pandas 
- numpy 
- sklearn 
- Matplotlib,seaborn 

About the dataset
According to the website for the UCI repository (ref. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail), this transactional dataset reflects transactions (approx. 1 year's worth) effected between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a registered non-store online retail based in the UK.
